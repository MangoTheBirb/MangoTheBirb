<h2> Hi, I’m Andrew </h2>
<img src="Logo.png" width="30%" height="30%" align="right">

I'm a big nerd and love anything tech. I am especially passionate about FPV drones, R/C cars and planes, robotics and really anything else electronic. I'm currently studying computing at Queen's University.

My most recent project has been working on using a Raspberry Pi with a 4g cellular HAT and a camera to control an R/C car so that I can explore anywhere with a cell signal.
