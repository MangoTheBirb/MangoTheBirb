ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew Terry

I'm a big nerd and love anything tech. I am especially passionate about FPV drones, R/C cars and planes, electronics, and robotics. I'm currently studying computing at Queen's University.

I am currently working on using a raspberry pi with a 4g cellular HAT and a camera to control an R/C car and make rover that can go anywhere with a cell signal.
