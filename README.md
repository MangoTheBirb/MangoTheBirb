<h2> Hi, I’m Andrew </h2>
<img src="Logo.png" width="30%" height="30%" align="right">

I'm a big nerd and love anything tech. I am especially passionate about FPV drones, R/C cars and planes, electronics, and robotics. I'm currently studying computing at Queen's University and am part of the Queen's Knights robomaster team in the AIM division.

My most recent project has been working on using a raspberry pi with a 4g cellular HAT and a camera to control an R/C car and make rover that can go anywhere with a cell signal.
